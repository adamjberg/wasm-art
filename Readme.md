## Description

This project is an experiment in a potential use case for WebAssembly.  For now it allows uploading a wasm module that exports a `draw` function that can prepare pixel data to draw on a JS canvas.  The longer term idea is to allow people to upload their wasm modules for a sort of gallery of animations.  This is currently more of a Proof of concept that will evolve over time.

## Examples

See the [/examples](examples) folder for some samples of how to prepare a wasm module to upload.
